## Proposed Implementation
<%= it.proposal %>

## Your Task

Review this implementation proposal against the actual codebase patterns.

### Step 1: Verify Patterns
For each pattern used in the proposal, search the codebase to verify it's correct:

- **Dependency injection**: How are services actually instantiated in this codebase? Search for container/factory patterns.
- **Configuration**: How is the Environment type structured? Is config flat or nested?
- **Error handling**: Are there error serialization utilities? How are errors logged?
- **Optional services**: How does the codebase handle missing/optional dependencies?
- **Imports and naming**: Do the import paths and naming conventions match?

### Step 2: Search and Compare
Use RipGrep and ReadFiles to find actual examples in the codebase. Don't assume the proposal is correct.

### Step 3: Output Final Implementation
After verifying, output ONLY the final implementation plan:
- Do NOT include "corrections made" or "summary of changes" sections
- Do NOT explain what you verified or changed
- Output the implementation as if it were your original answer
- Format it cleanly, ready to be used directly as an implementation plan

IMPORTANT: Make your verification searches IN PARALLEL to be efficient.
