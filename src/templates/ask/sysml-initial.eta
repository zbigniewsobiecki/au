The complete SysML model is available in the `<sysml-model>` section above. Answer the question by searching through the pre-loaded model content.

The complete SysML model is available in the `<sysml-model>` section above.

Answer the question using the pre-loaded model content:
1. Search through the `<sysml-model>` section for relevant definitions
2. Trace relationships (specializations, connections, type references)
3. Synthesize a complete answer with:
   - Detailed explanation referencing specific components
   - D2 diagram for architecture/flow questions

The refinement phase will verify your answer against source code.

Before answering, you must explore the codebase using ReadFiles or RipGrep. The SysML model provided gives you semantic understanding, but you need to read actual source code to give a thorough, grounded answer.

Question: <%= it.question %>
<% if (!it.preload && !it.sysmlOnly && !it.codeOnly) { %>

For implementation questions, you must first discover existing patterns:
1. Use SysMLQuery to find relevant definitions and their relationships
2. Use SysMLRead to understand the architecture from the model
3. Search for similar existing implementations in source code
4. Search for error handling patterns (how are errors caught and logged?)
5. Search for configuration patterns (how do services get their config?)

Only propose an implementation that mirrors these patterns exactly. Show code examples from the codebase that your proposal follows.

IMPORTANT - Use a two-phase approach:

PHASE 1 (first turn) - Understand via SysML:
- Use SysMLQuery to find relevant definitions, relationships, and packages
- Use SysMLRead on relevant files to understand architecture, patterns, and design
- The SysML model gives you the semantic map - use it to understand the system

PHASE 2 (second turn) - Verify via source code:
- ReadFiles for implementation details of the most relevant files
- RipGrep for specific patterns (error handling, logging, config)

Batch calls within each phase - don't make sequential single tool calls.

Use the SysML model tools to answer this question:
1. Start with SysMLQuery to find relevant definitions
2. Use SysMLRead to get detailed information from specific packages
3. Map the question to the appropriate package:
   - Architecture/structure → structure/
   - Data models → data/
   - Workflows/behavior → behavior/
   - Requirements → context/
   - Tests → verification/
