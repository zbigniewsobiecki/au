<% if (it.planCaptured) { %>
DocPlan was successfully captured. You may now call `FinishPlanning` with a summary.
<% } else { %>
**DocPlan was NOT captured.** Your previous DocPlan call likely had a parsing error (e.g., duplicate parameter keys like `documents/1/title` appearing twice). Please re-call `DocPlan` with a valid plan — ensure no duplicate keys — then call `FinishPlanning`.
