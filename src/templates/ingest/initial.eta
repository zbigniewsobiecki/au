Document this codebase efficiently:

1. Source files are pre-loaded below - don't re-read files you can already see
2. Document 3-5 files per response using multiple AUUpdate(path=".") calls
3. Start with entry points and work through the codebase

For maximum efficiency, batch your AUUpdate calls - don't stop after documenting one file.
